Hi! I am Amruta Parulekar, a fifth year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I am pursuing an integrated B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering and Masters in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, along with a Minor in Computer Science. I love travelling, hiking, and everything to do with nature. Cats, dogs and coffee happen to be great weaknesses :)

Research Interests
======
I love working on real-world applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Be it computer vision, natural language processing, or reinforcement learning, I enjoy learning and exploring the concepts and then using them to try and make a difference where I can! Some examples include:

* Working in collaboration with doctors to use artificial intelligence techniques for more efficient diagnosis and treatment of different health conditions.
* Building and deploying tools for automatic speech recognition, speech generation and machine translation for low resource Indian and African Languages.
* Developing tools for industrial safety such as accident predictors in power plants and personal protective equipment detectors for factory workers.

In my free time, I enjoy art, photography and music. I play the keyboard and have tried my hand at every medium, from pencil sketching, water colors, to acryllics on canvas and even roads.
