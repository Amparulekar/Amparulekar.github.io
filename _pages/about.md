Hi! I am Amruta Parulekar, a fifth year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I am pursuing an integrated B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering and Masters in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, along with a Minor in Computer Science. I love travelling, hiking, and everything to do with nature. Cats, dogs and coffee happen to be great weaknesses :)

I have worked under the guidance of [Prof. Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/) for using multimodal (primarily image) data for medical diagnostics. I have also been guided by [Prof. Lueder Kahrs](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/math-cs-stats/people/lueder-kahrs) on using computer vision techniques for laryngeal surgery assistance. I am currently working under [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) on multilingual speech recognition and generation for low resource languages. I have been awarded two Undergraduate Research awards by IIT Bombay for these research contributions.

Research Interests
======
I love working on real-world applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I also enjoy mixing modalities and have experimented with speech, text, image as well as numerical data. Be it computer vision, natural language processing, or reinforcement learning, I like learning and exploring the concepts and then using them to try and make a difference where I can! Some examples include:

* Working in collaboration with doctors to use artificial intelligence techniques for more efficient diagnosis and treatment of different health conditions.
* Building and deploying tools for automatic speech recognition, speech generation and machine translation to aid education in low resource languages.
* Developing tools for industrial safety such as accident predictors in power plants and personal protective equipment detectors for factory workers.

I also enjoy teaching and mentoring, having been a teaching assistant for the Automatic Speech Recognition (CS 753) , Engineering Graphics and Drawing (ME 119) and Biology (BB 101) courses at IIT Bombay. I have also been a department academic mentor for over a year and received the best mentor award. I have served as a mentor for several AI/ML programs in IIT Bombay clubs.

In my free time, I enjoy art, photography and music. I play the keyboard and have tried my hand at every medium, from pencil sketching, water colors, to acryllics on canvas and even roads.
