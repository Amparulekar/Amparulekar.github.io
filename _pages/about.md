Hi! I am Amruta Parulekar, a first year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am an [Amazon AI PhD Fellow](https://www.amazon.science/news/amazon-launches-68-million-ai-phd-fellowship-program) and am advised by [Prof. Hari Sundaram](https://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/). I will also be closely collaborating with [Prof. Dilek Hakkani-Tur](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/dilek).

I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering, M.Tech. in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science, and Minor in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. There, I worked with [Prof. Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/) on using multimodal (primarily image) data for medical diagnostics. In my third year, I interned with [Prof. Lueder Kahrs](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/math-cs-stats/people/lueder-kahrs) and used computer vision techniques for laryngeal surgery assistance. For my Master's Thesis, I was advised by [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/), and worked on multilingual speech recognition and generation for low resource languages. I have been awarded two Undergraduate Research awards by IIT Bombay for these research contributions.

Research Interests
======

 The problems that I am currently exploring are:

* Improving the reasoning of LLMs on multimodal, multi-lingual or domain-specific tasks
* Understanding LLM behaviour such as sycophancy and toxicity and improving user safety
* User-centric conversational AI, especially multi-lingual and multi-modal usecases


I love working on real-world Artificial Intelligence applications. I also enjoy mixing modalities and have worked with speech, text, image as well as numerical data. I want to use my natural language processing, computer vision and reinforcement learning knowledge to make a difference where I can!

<!--* Working in collaboration with doctors to use artificial intelligence techniques for more efficient diagnosis and treatment of different health conditions.
* Building and deploying tools for automatic speech recognition, speech generation and machine translation to aid education in low resource languages.
* Developing tools for industrial safety such as accident predictors in power plants and personal protective equipment detectors for factory workers.-->

Additional Interests
======

I also enjoy teaching and mentoring, having been a teaching assistant for several courses at IIT Bombay including Foundations of Machine Learning and Automatic Speech Recognition. I have also been a department academic mentor for two years and received the best mentor award. I have served as a mentor for several AI/ML programs in IIT Bombay clubs.

I love travelling, hiking, and everything to do with nature. Cats, dogs and coffee happen to be great weaknesses :) In my free time, I enjoy art, photography and music. I play the keyboard and have tried my hand at every medium, from pencil sketching, water colors, to acryllics on canvas and even roads.
