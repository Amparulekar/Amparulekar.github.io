Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled training data. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning and text-only adaptation are two widely used approaches to address these constraints. In this study, we explore how these techniques can be effectively combined using a multilingual multimodal model like SeamlessM4T. Multimodal models can leverage unlabeled text through text-only adaptation alongside parameter-efficient ASR fine-tuning, resulting in improved ASR performance. Additionally, we demonstrate cross-lingual transfer from a high-resource language, achieving up to a 17% relative reduction in WER in a zero-shot setting without any labeled speech data.
