Using deep neural networks (DNNs) to segment and classify cell nuclei can help pathologists diagnose diseases faster, including cancer. DNNs get more accurate with more annotated datasets for training. The published datasets with nuclear annotations and labeling vary in their class label sets. We present a method for training DNNs on numerous datasets with related but distinct classes. Our solution uses class hierarchies, allowing for classes at any level of a dataset.
