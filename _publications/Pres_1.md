Eosinophils are normally seen in healthy people's gastrointestinal tracts. When eosinophils in the GI tract rise above their normal levels, a patient has a variety of symptoms. Clinicians have difficulty diagnosing eosinophilia. Patients can benefit from early diagnosis and treatment. Histopathology is considered the gold standard for diagnosing this illness. Because this is an underdiagnosed illness, quantifying eosinophils in GI tract biopsies is crucial. In this study, we trained and evaluated a deep neural network based on UNet to recognize and count eosinophils in gastrointestinal tract biopsies. We employed connected component analysis to extract eosinophils. We investigated the association between eosinophilic infiltration counted by AI and a manual count. The GI tract biopsy slides were stained with H&E stain. Slides were scanned using a camera connected to a microscope, and five high-power field photos were captured each slide. On 300 held-out (test) photos, the Pearson correlation coefficient was 85% for eosinophil counts detected by machine and manually.
