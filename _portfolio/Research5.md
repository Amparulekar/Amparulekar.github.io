*Bachelor’s Thesis-II at the Medical Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab (In collaboration with TATA Cancer Research Hospital) | Guide: Prof. Amit Sethi*

* Created neural cox proportional hazards models for genomic data using graph neural networks and neural ranking
* Employed Discriminator-based domain adaptation and transfer learning to use mouse data to fortify human TCGA data
* Attained 0.88 concordance index by including clinical and image data, and gene subset selection with L1 regularization
* Created a novel Cross Modal Alignment-based Genomics Token Learning Network that surpassed the TranMIL baseline
