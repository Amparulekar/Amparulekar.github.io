*Master’s Thesis-I (Nationwide project - Bhashini, NLTM) at the Computational Speech and Language Technologies Lab, IIT Bombay, Guide: Prof. Preethi Jyothi*

**Summary:** *This project aimed to develop LASER, a finegrained LLM-based metric for Automatic Speech Recognition.*

*Paper published at the Empirical Methods in Natural language Processing (EMNLP) 2025 (Main conference)*

* LASER handles linguistic nuances of Indian Languages, transfers across languages and correlates well with human scores
* Achieved 88.69% accuracy on finetuning Llama 3-8B to get a standardized and efficient pipeline to execute our metric
