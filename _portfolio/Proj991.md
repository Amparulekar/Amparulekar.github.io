* Achieved a six-fold cost reduction for our product over industrial grade by optimal use of in-house components
* Designed a printed circuit board to host the power supply, temperature sensor, cooling fans and microcontroller
* Implemented PID control algorithm to follow the reflow soldering thermal profile on an AT89C5131 microcontroller
