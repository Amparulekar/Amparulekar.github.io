**Summary:** *Ultrasound (US) imaging is cost-effective, safe and real-time, but it contains noise and artifacts. This project aimed at providing surgeons with mammogram-like image quality in real-time from by modelling ultrasound noise.*

*Paper submitted to the Ultrasonics Journal. 1 review round completed.*

* Pre-processed CTs to speed of sound images to simulate US through wave interference equations using the Stride module
* Applied Fourier Domain Adaptation (FDA) to enhance the quality of simulated images using authentic ultrasound images
* Utilized CycleGANs and Pix2pix to generate CT scans from simulated ultrasound images, achieving an MSE of 0.008
