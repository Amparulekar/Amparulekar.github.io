* Modifying Metaâ€™s SeamlessM4T for automatic speech recognition in low resource languages like Maithili and Konkani
* Harnessing computationally efficient techniques like parameter-efficient finetuning and Low-rank adaptor tuning
* Evaluating benefits of cross-lingual pivot testing and semi-supervised learning to mitigate lack of annotated data
