* Carried out an extensive literature survey on various convolutional neural network architectures within 10M parameters to classify images in the CUB dataset
* Performed hyperparameter tuning of learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to improve accuracy from 54.69% to 73.92%
* Designed and modified a network based on CBDNet to deblur images corrupted using Gaussian blur filters of different sizes and extent of blurring
* Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve the peak signal-to-noise ratio from 26.68 to 28.42
