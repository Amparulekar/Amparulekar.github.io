*Bachelor’s Thesis-I at the Medical Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab, IIT Bombay (In collaboration with TATA Cancer Research Hospital) Guide: Prof. Amit Sethi*

* Designed a novel loss function to consolidate fine-grained and hierarchical class labels of PanNuke, MoNuSAC, CoNSeP
* Achieved improvements on test sets and Domain Generalization on unseen segmentation and classification datasets
* Mitigated class imbalance and staining variability using focal loss, normalization, elastic and colorjitter augmentation
* Trained deep learning models like UNet and Stardist resulting in eosinophilia detection with 85 percent accuracy
