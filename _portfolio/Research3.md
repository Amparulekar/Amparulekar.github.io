*Bachelor’s Project-I (Collaboration with TATA Cancer Research Hospital) at the Medical Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab, IIT Bombay, Guide: Prof. Amit Sethi*

**Summary:** *Segmentation and classification of cell nuclei in biopsies helps with the diagnosis of several conditions, saving clinicians’ time. Staining variability of dyes used, severe class imbalance and variation of class labels in open source datasets were some challenges mitigated by us in this project, to consolidate datasets and detect eosinophilia.*

* Designed a novel loss function to consolidate fine-grained and hierarchical class labels of PanNuke, MoNuSAC, CoNSeP, achieving improvements on test sets and domain generalization on unseen segmentation and classification datasets
* Combined focal loss and colorjitter augmentation with UNet-based Stardist to detect eosinophilia with 85% accuracy
