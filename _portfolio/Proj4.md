* Modelled the activity of spiking neurons like Izhikevich and Hodgkin-Huxley to determine the energy cost of a spike
* Analysed the effects of time varying Poisson distribution-based stimuli on the AEF RS neurons with distinct synapses
* Designed a neuronal circuit in Spiking Equilibrium using 45 nm CMOS technology for Low Power Real time Learning
