A series of assignments in which we:
* Implemented variants of Thompson Sampling and KL-UCB for solving a Batched Multi-armed Bandits Problem
* Executed Markov Decision Process planning to devise an optimal strategies for half-field football offence and a billiards
game, using Value iteration, Linear Programming, Howardâ€™s Policy Iteration and Monte-Carlo Tree search
