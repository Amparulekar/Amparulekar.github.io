* Built LSTM and Transformer models from scratch and a BERT-based transformer model to predict sentence toxicity
* Incorporated feature engineering with a parts of speech tagger to capture sentiment and style of toxic comments
* Successfully ranked responses of an LLM to prompts based on their toxicity and used style transfer decrease toxicity
