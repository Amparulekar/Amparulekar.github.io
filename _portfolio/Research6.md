*Bachelor’s Project-II (Collaboration with TATA Cancer Research Hospital) at the Medical Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab, IIT Bombay, Guide: Prof. Amit Sethi*

**Summary:** *In this project, we combined genetic information, chemotherapy drug properties, patient demographics and imaging data of different kinds to predict tumor progression free interval and effectiveness of chemotherapies.*

*Paper submitted to IEEE ISBI 2025 (International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging*

[**Paper link**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00749)

* Created neural Cox Proportional Hazards models for genomic data using graph neural networks and neural ranking
* Employed discriminator-based domain adaptation and transfer learning to use mouse data to fortify human TCGA data
* Attained 0.88 concordance index by including clinical and image data, and gene subset selection with L1 regularization
* Created a novel cross modal alignment-based genomics token learning network that surpassed the TransMIL baseline
