*Research Assistant at the Medical Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab, (In collaboration with TATA Cancer Research Hospital) Guide: Prof. Amit Sethi*

* Pre-processed CTs to speed of sound images to simulate US through wave interference equations using Stride module
* Applied Fourier Domain Adaptation to enhance the quality of simulated images with authentic ultrasound images
* Utilized CycleGANs and pix2pix to generate CT scans from simulated ultrasound (US) images, achieving an MSE of 0.008
