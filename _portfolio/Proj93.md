* Implemented the Transformers Library and neural networks like LSTM RNNs for Text Style Transfer
* Used a pipeline-based approach involving a parts-of-speech tagger, a sentence similarity checker that used cosine similarity to match dataset sentences to the input sentence and a generative model to generate formal adjectives
* Developed a Shakespearean Paraphraser and further application of the concept to chatbots
