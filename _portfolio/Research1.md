*Master’s Thesis-I (Nationwide project - Bhashini, NLTM) at the Computational Speech and Language Technologies Lab, IIT Bombay, Guides: Prof. Preethi Jyothi, Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharya*

**Summary:** *This project involves creating multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition tools robust to mispronunciation, along with requiring low computation, less data and specifically catering to low resource languages.*

* Designed a novel strategy to incorporate paraphrase supervision in multimodal models and improve ASR for noisy speech
* Developed a novel sequential method to combine speech-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning and text-only adaptation for multimodal multilingual models like SeamlessM4T, improving ASR on 10+ low-resource Indian and African languages
* Obtained a 40% WER reduction over baseline on IndicVoices-Maithili and identified a cross-lingual transfer technique that can give more than 17% relative reduction in WER for a low-resource language without using any speech of that language
