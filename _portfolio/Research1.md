*Research Internship at the University of Toronto (MITACS scholarship) Guide: Prof. Lueder Kahrs*
* Worked on the use of Neural Radiance fields(NeRF) for 3D visualization of vocal folds in sub-glottic stenosis patients
* Performed automated vocal fold motion tracking using Image processing techniques and the AGATI Software
* Developed an end-to-end preprocessing pipeline and a fully annotated dataset of laryngoscopic images for further use
