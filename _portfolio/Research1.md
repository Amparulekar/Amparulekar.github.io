*Research Internship at the Medical Computer Vision and Robotics Lab, University of Toronto (MITACS scholarship) Guide: Prof. Lueder Kahrs*

* Worked on the use of Neural Radiance fields (NeRF) for 3D visualization of vocal folds in sub-glottic stenosis patients
* Implemented automated vocal fold motion tracking using Image processing techniques and the AGATI Software
* Carried out image denoising using blur and specularity detection and removal and reported PSNR and SSIM scores
* Executed color and brightness correction with histogram manipulation and created an annotated laryngoscopy dataset
