* Implemented a Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol using UDP sockets for reliable data transfer with sequence numbering and retransmissions.
* Simulated packet loss with a probability factor and handled acknowledgments to ensure accurate packet delivery.
* Logged all sent packets, acknowledgments, and retransmissions in text files, and used network delay emulation for realistic testing.
